### Welcome to LaunchFight's official GitHub!
<hr>
LaunchFight is a Minecraft server that aims to improve the overall "Minecraft" experience by providing unique gamemodes that weren't seen before.
<br>
<br>
The main name "LaunchFight," comes from the gamemode that allows you to launch around the map while fighting other people with unique weapons.

<br>
<br>

We are currently planning to make:
 - The actual network
 - More gamemodes, other than LaunchFight itself
 - A whole lobby
 - More coming soon!

**Here's some print line:**
